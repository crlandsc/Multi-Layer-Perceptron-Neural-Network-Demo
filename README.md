# Basic Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network

### A simple multi-layer perceptron neural network built from scratch

This code implements a basic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network from scratch. The purpose of this is to illustrate the inner workings of a neural network by building one from the ground up and then demonstrate how easily it can be replicated when utilizing TensorFlow.

Read my blog post about MLPs [here.](https://medium.com/@crlandschoot/how-do-neural-networks-really-work-ac137e0b052)

**NOTE: This code is a modified version of code from [Valerio Velardo's (The Sound of AI)](https://www.youtube.com/@ValerioVelardoTheSoundofAI) [source code](https://github.com/musikalkemist/DeepLearningForAudioWithPython). Please see license for copyright information.**

## Motivation
When working with machine learning (ML) models, we use pre-built libraries with immense functionality all of the time. While it is efficient to utilize what has already been constructed (why reinvent the wheel?), this never truly imparts an understanding of the math that lives under the hood. Without an understanding of the components of a system, you can never utilize it to its full potential. The motivation for replicating this code was to provide a deeper understanding for myself and others of a simple neural net so that each element is more tangible.

**Note** that while a simple dense network as described below would not be used for audio machine learning tasks (which is my primary interest), the principles demonstrated here undergird the processes of more complex CNNs, RNNs, etc.

## MLP Neural Network Background

An MLP is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, also known as neurons. It is a feedforward neural network (aka "dense" network), which means that the input data flows through the network in one direction, and the output is generated at the end of the network.

The architecture of an MLP includes an input layer, hidden layers, an output layer, activation functions, and weights and biases.

- **Input Layer:** The input layer is the first layer of the MLP, where the raw input data is fed into the network. Each neuron in the input layer corresponds to one input feature of the data. The neurons in this layer do not perform any computation and simply pass the input data to the next layer.

- **Hidden Layers:**  The hidden layers are the layers between the input and output layers, where the computation of the network occurs. Each neuron in the hidden layers receives input from the neurons in the previous layer, computes a weighted sum of these inputs, applies an activation function, and outputs the result to the next layer. The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer are hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve the performance of the MLP.

- **Output Layer:** The output layer is the last layer of the MLP, where the final output of the network is generated. The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the type of problem the MLP is being used to solve. For example, in a speech recognition task, the output layer may have neurons corresponding to phonemes or words. In a music genre classification task, the output layer may have neurons corresponding to different genres.

- **Activation Functions:** Activation functions are used in the hidden layers to introduce nonlinearity into the network, which allows it to model complex relationships between the input and output. A range of activation functions can be utilized, but in our case, we are specifically implementing the sigmoid function.

- **Weights and Biases:** Each neuron in the MLP is associated with a set of weights and biases, which are learned during the training process. The weights determine the strength of the connections between the neurons, while the biases control the threshold at which the neuron activates. The learning algorithm, gradient descent in our model, adjusts the weights and biases to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output, which allows the MLP to learn to make accurate predictions on new data. Our model implements a backpropagation optimization algorithm to calculate errors to influence the gradient descent. A common error metric, such as mean squared error (MSE), can be used to measure the performance of the model.

The principles demonstrated in these MLPs are used in a variety of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and predictive modeling. They are known for their ability to handle complex nonlinear relationships in data and can be used for both regression and classification tasks. However, they can be computationally expensive to train and require large amounts of data to achieve good performance.
