"""This is sample code to demonstrate the inner-workings of a neural network.
Below we build a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Dense (aka Feedforward) Neural Network.

We then test the neural net with two input numbers when added together equal the output number.
This trains the model to learn that adding these two numbers together will equal the output number.
The error values are printed for each learning step to see how the model is learning.
